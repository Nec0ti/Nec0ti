  Hi, I'm Necati. People online usually know me as <b>Necoti</b> or <b>Neco</b> for short.<br>
  I'm currently learning <b>C</b>, while also working with <b>JavaScript, Python and C#</b>.<br>
  (Yes, I know HTML and CSS, but I don't count them as programming languages.)

## About me
- I'm a highschool student on my way to becoming an **Electrical-Electronics Engineer**.  
- My long-term goal is to work as an **Embedded Engineer**.  
- I like being close to the metal, understanding how things really work under the surface.  
- I don’t just want to write code — I want to build systems that live in both hardware and software.  

---

## Current focus
- Learning C and low-level programming.  
- Getting comfortable with problem solving instead of just syntax.  
- Building small but real projects to sharpen my skills.
